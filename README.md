# Culvert Parser
A python cli program designed for the MMORPG Maplestory, which uses Optical Character Recognition to automate data tabulation

In order to not actually break ToS, this program will work by taking in screenshots, then producing a CSV, which can then be uploaded onto an excel of sorts, into a database, queried, etc

The OpenCV library will be used, and probably use OCR

The format it expects is just what's viewable in-game. Do not include the top part
Anything else will be undefined behaviour, and good luck in that case

Misuse of this program is prohibited, and the first piece of evidence I find that this is used to bully others, I will consider bricking the project or naming and shaming.

Just a Markdown file to describe the files that are part of this testing suite

So the rundown is,

sample1 -> 3 image files, jpg and png
sample2 -> single jpeg file
sample3 -> txt file
sample4 -> Contains actual images of culvert scores, which I will not be sharing here due to confidentiality
            When I get bothered, I'll photoshop some images to upload here, but the contents of the tests should be same
            You are welcome to add your own here, and test accordingly

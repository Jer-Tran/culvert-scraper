Just a Markdown file to describe the files that are part of this testing suite

So the rundown is,

sample1 -> 3 image files, jpg and png
sample2 -> single jpeg file
sample3 -> txt file
sample4-6 ->    Contains actual images of culvert scores, which I will not be sharing here due to confidentiality
                When I get bothered, I'll photoshop some images to upload here, but the contents of the tests should be same
                You are welcome to add your own here, and test accordingly

Folders 4-7
4. Individual files are being checked, containing criteria for
    - a
    - b
    - c
5. No overlap, two separate images    
6. Has 2 images of some overlap
7. Has 2 images where one is a subset of the other's data, basically a crop of the other


filters - made for test_output.py, which is the end-to-end tests in essence
1. Standard, contains every name for example.png
2. uhh


The contents of sample images and filters are missing for now
I'll get around to producing the required files once implementation requires me to get those tests done, but I do find value that I've scoped out the tests in advance
